\chapter{Background Knowledge and Related work}
%What I really want to outline here is that I am reviewing work related to a pretty narrow field - that of target detection in a forensic management scene. After giving some broader information related to multi-agent systems etc., give a narrower summary of work in this field.

\workinprogress

As mentioned in the introduction chapter, the research outlined in this thesis was motivated and funded by an EU Horizon 2020 project called ROCSAFE, which involves investigating the automation of certain aspects of the management and examination of a crime scene in the forensic stage of analysis. Accordingly, this chapter outlines existing research specifically related to the application of agent-based systems in this area, while also providing a broad overview of single and multi-agent systems and general techniques commonly used in such systems to solve abstract problems. \par
First, an broad overview of agent-based systems is given, mainly outlining common approaches in agent and multi-agent system design. This leads to a more focused discussion on how agents and multi-agent systems have been designed in work that is tightly related to that of this thesis. The literature relating to multi-agent probabilistic search and multi-agent coverage is then reviewed. Techniques used to reach the current state-of-the-art for these problems are identified and discussed. Finally, work previously done in simulating environments for systems that will operate in a complex real-world scenario is reviewed.
