This thesis is outlined as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Chapter \ref{chapter:Background} outlines some essential background knowledge related to the ROCSAFE project, agent and multi-agent systems, hidden Markov models, dynamic Bayesian networks and high-fidelity game engine environments. 
    \item Chapter \ref{chap:HighFidelitySim} provides the details of the development of the high-fidelity simulation environment mentioned above in the contributions section. We provide an exposition on the techniques that we used to achieve a high level of realism. We also outline the integration of a plugin called Airsim \cite{Shah2017AirSim:Vehicles}, which facilitated the use of virtual \textbf{R}emote \textbf{A}erial \textbf{V}ehicles (RAVs). We finally discuss potential applications for the simulation environment.
    \item Chapter \ref{chapter:SceneSurveying} is concerned with outlining the solution we implemented to solve the problem of Scene Surveying. A simplified version of the problem is first explored. We provide algorithms and some sample results outlining the advantages of the explored solution. We then move to the complete version of the problem, that introduces additional constraints. An implemented solution is discussed, which uses an open-source solver to generate solutions. 
    \item Chapter \ref{chap:targetLocalisation}
