\subsection{Executing Agent Routes in Simulation}\label{subsec:routesInSimulation}
In order to test the algorithms developed in this chapter in a realistic scenario, we utilised the simulation environment described in Chapter \ref{chap:HighFidelitySim}. The AirSim plugin \cite{Shah2017AirSim:Vehicles} provides a straightforward interface to be able to configure the simulation environment to run with a user specified number of RAVs, with an API to send commands to each. We successfully ran a number of tests in simulation using the UI to select the bounding area and grid spacing for the RAVs, which interfaced with the code which generated the routes for the RAVs. We then used the AirSim API to send the virtual RAVs to the generated waypoints on each route to gather images. The results of a simulation run showing the executed routes are shown in Figure \ref{fig:VirtualPlannedRoutes}
