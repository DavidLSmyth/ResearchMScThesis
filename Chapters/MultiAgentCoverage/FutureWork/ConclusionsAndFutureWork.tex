\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:SurveyingConclusionFutureWork}
In this chapter we provided the details of how a swarm of UAVs can be used to gather data in a given region described by a polygon. We first described how to discretise the region into a set of grid points. We made some minor modifications to ensure that the implementation would be able to deal with real-world usage, which in practice takes the form of using the coordinate system that GPS depends on. We then implemented a Nearest Neighbor (NN) heuristic algorithm to generate routes for the swarm of UAVs which visit each grid point in the region exactly once, which is a solution to the multiple Travelling Salesman Problem. For practical purposes in relation to ROCSAFE \cite{rocsafeNUIG}, the project that has funded this work, this offered a simple and scalable solution the surveying problem, but not a particularly efficient one. In order to run tests, we then used a web development framework to design a UI to interact with the grid generation code and the NN algorithm, which we used to generate some results which can be seen in tables \ref{table:NNAlgoResultsRect}, \ref{table:NNAlgoResultsTri}, \ref{table:NNAlgoResultsHex}, \ref{table:NNAlgoResultsIrregular}. Finally, we used the simulation environment, outlined in Chapter \ref{chap:HighFidelitySim}, to run further tests which offer highly realistic conditions, since the virtual UAVs run autopilot software that is used on real-world UAVs. These tests were carried out successfully and the results are illustrated in \ref{fig:VirtualPlannedRoutes}. 

We then began investigating using an optimisation tool to solve the more general problem of surveying with constrains such as heterogeneous UAV battery capacities, sampling times and operational speeds. We used the open-source Apache licensed OR-Tools respository to develop a prototypical solution. This solution took orders of magnitude longer to calculate solutions compared to the NN algorithm, but offered qualitatively good solutions to the more general problem.



\subsubsection{Future Work}
Since we were limited by time constraints with this work, we outline some future work that we planned but did not have the time to execute. We describe some future work that could be done to build on the basic solutions to the problem of finding a scalable solution to the mTSP and VRP described in this chapter. The points outlined are all taken to be specific to the Euclidean grid-based approach that was discussed throughout this chapter.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The NN solution offered a method that could provide qualitatively good solutions in many scenarios 
    
    \item The quality of the solution to the TSP given by the NN algorithm is known to be dependent on the start position <suitable reference missing>. A common improvement to the algorithm is to run it $n$ times for each possible starting point at each node in the network of $n$ nodes, and then take the best solution found. In the case of the mTSP, for $k$ UAVs, this would mean exploring ${n \choose k}$ different combinations of starting positions, which may make the running time of the algorithm prohibitively long. Therefore, future research could explore an effective way of determining the best starting nodes for the UAVs without implementing a brute force search to improve the NN solution.
    \item Many solutions to the mTSP problem use \textit{iterative improvement} strategies,  which use an existing algorithm to create a solution, then have another algorithm improve the solution.\textit{ Ensemble} strategies are also frequently used, which applies a set of algorithms to the  problem and returns the best solution. The use of either of these techniques with the NN algorithm could provide significantly better results, especially given that this has been shown in the case of Euclidean distance cost functions. For example, reversing some segments that "cross" guarantees an improvement via the \textit{triangle inequality}, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fixingTourCrossing}. 
    \item Many open-source and commercial linear program solvers exist which are optimized to deal with the mTSP and VRP. We discussed how we used Google's OR-Tools repository <link in footnote> to prototype a solution. Future work could involve optimising the configuration of the problem and choice of back-end solver to produce a scalable solution.
    \item Representing the problem in a different manner may yield a suitable solution that is easier to computer. For example, representing the region to survey as continuous space rather than a discrete grid may facilitate the development of a control algorithm that is simpler and more effective in solving the surveying problem than the ones that exist that deal with discrete grids.
    \item Further theoretical analysis of the algorithm performance could yield insight in how to improve it. Given that it solves some instances of the problem with good results, e.g. that of Figure \ref{table:NNAlgoResultsRect}, the simple, scalable NN solution could be modified to deal with more general problems by using a divide-and-conquer approach to smaller rectangular regions.
    \item UAVs may be unreliable and the assumptions of deterministic sampling times and transition times between locations are not valid in real-world application. A decentralized algorithm which can handle this inherent stochastic element would provide a more robust solution to the surveying problem using multiple UAVs, which could be far superior to the solution presented in this thesis.
