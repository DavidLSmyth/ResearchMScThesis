\chapter{Scene Surveying}\label{chapter:SceneSurveying}
In this chapter, we provide details of the techniques and software developed to address the problem of aiding autonomous scene surveying, which was identified as part of the first research question stated in Section \ref{sec:ResearchQuestions}:

\par As with the rest of the work in this thesis, this chapter is motivated by the context of the ROCSAFE project, but we present the work in a general setting. In the initial phase of any crime scene investigation, it is desirable for the crime scene manager to visually scan the entire crime scene area to thoroughly assess the scene as early as possible \cite{TechnicalWorkingGrouponCrimeSceneInvestigation2013CrimeEnforcement}. We will henceforth refer to the area to be scanned as the \textit{region of interest} for the purpose of generality. In the ROCSAFE project, it is intended to address this problem using a fleet of RAVs, which are equipped with cameras and sensors which are highly suited to data-gathering. The RAVs can operate concurrently and can communicate with a centralised controller. We developed a system to autonomously survey a hazardous situation using the simulation environment described in Chapter \ref{chap:HighFidelitySim}. We published this work in a number of papers \cite{Smyth2018AInvestigation}, \cite{Smyth2018ASupport}, \cite{Smyth2018UsingDrones}.
%The information acquired by this initial sweep can be used for a multitude of purposes and generally speaking the sooner it can be gathered, the better, since it will often be subjected to time-consuming analysis. 
%We used the simulation environment described in Section \ref{chap:HighFidelitySim} to test the developed system.
%In order to ensure that the solutions explored are not domain-specific, we make few assumptions regarding the nature of the hardware used to solve the problem. 
\par We began by providing a description of the two main sub-problems identified as part of autonomous scene-surveying:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given a polygonal region defined by a set of points that lie on the earth's surface, generate a discrete set of cells of uniform area that partition the region of interest.
    %according to a user-specified height and width. 
    The cells can be described by their center points, as they are assumed to be of uniform height and width. We will refer to this set as $R$, the set of \textit{waypoints}.
    \item Find a set of routes for each of $K$ RAVs to be used in the data-gathering process, such that these sets partition $R$ and the cost of the system of RAVs traversing these points is minimized. %Objective functions which define the cost of traversal are discussed in <reference relevant section>.
\end{enumerate}

Hence there are two main goals: find a discrete representation of a continuous area which represents the region of interest, and then find routes that the RAVs can execute in order to visit each of the grid points exactly once, while minimising the cost of doing so. 
%We then give a mathematical definition of the sub-problems in sections \ref{sec:GenerationOfWaypoints}, \ref{subsec:SimplifiedVRP} and \ref{sec:SceneSurveyingBatteryConstraints}.
