This section outlines the algorithms that were explored to generate a set of routes for the UAVs that will be used to record sensor data at each of the grid points generated in the region of interest, which are generated using the algorithm described in the preceding section. We make some assumptions related to the solution of this problem:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each UAV is assumed to have the same internal representation of the region of interest, namely the set of grid points generated by algorithm \ref{alg:GridGeneration}.
\end{itemize}

Talk about how problem was transformed to TSP problem, took that and then divided up soln for mTSP.
