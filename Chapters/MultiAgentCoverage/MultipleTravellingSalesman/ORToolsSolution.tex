\subsection{Scene Surveying With Battery Constraints and Sampling Times}
Once we had prototyped the NN algorithm in order to find a suitable solution to the simplified problem, we then considered the more general problem, where UAVs have heterogeneous battery constraints, sampling times and 


\note{Keep this very brief - there is not a great research output here. Simply mention that we began looking into using solvers to calculate solutions.}
