\section{Conclusions}
\note{From C&B: In contrast with these previous works, the pre-sented research herein offers a sequential Bayesian formulation that addresses joint dependence of probabilities, the presence of both false-negative and false-positive detections, and constraints on searcher motion}

\note{however,  such  costly near-optimal approaches may be less desirable than algorithms that provide “good enough” solutions, where the application re-quires computationally limited platforms, such as educational robots  or  miniaturized  embedded  system}
