\subsection{Extensions to the Basic Agent}
The agent design outlined in the preceding sections of this chapter addresses the problem outlined in Section \ref{subsec:ProbDescription},  following the assumptions outlined in Section \ref{subsec:initalAssumptions}. As mentioned in Section \ref{subsec:initalAssumptions}, some of these assumptions are not realistic, which we address in this section. \par

\subsubsection{Multiple Targets}
The first assumption that we addressed is that there are either zero or one targets to be localised. In may applications, this is a
