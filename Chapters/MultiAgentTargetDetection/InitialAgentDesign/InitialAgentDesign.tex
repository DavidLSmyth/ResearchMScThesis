\section{Agent Design}\label{section:intial_agent_design}
\note{addressed some of these simultaneously (i.e. once I had decided model-based agent, then had to answer question of what model will look like)}
\note{probably best to list these individually with some corresponding discussion}

When designing the agent, we adhered the approach outlined in Chapter 2 of \cite{AIAMA}. First, we describe four critical parts of the agent design, collectively referred to as the agent's \textit{task environment}: the Actuators, Sensors, Environment, and Performance Element. Further discussion on specific aspects of how the agent function was implemented is then given.
%where the larger multi-faceted problem is broken down into smaller individual sub-problems.
