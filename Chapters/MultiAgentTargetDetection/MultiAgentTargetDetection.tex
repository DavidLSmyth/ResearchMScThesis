\chapter{Multi-Agent Stochastic Target Localization}
\placeholder{}
This chapter outlines the approach taken to solve the research question stated in the introduction chapter. The context for this problem is derived from the ROCSAFE project \cite{rocsafeNUIG}. \note{Not sure how best to present the problem and how to provide the necessary content to naturally leads to the approaches discussed here. Fill this out further once research questions have been finalized/refined}
