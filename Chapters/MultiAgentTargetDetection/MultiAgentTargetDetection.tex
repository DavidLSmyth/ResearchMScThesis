\chapter{Multi-Agent Stochastic Target Localization}
\placeholder{}
This chapter outlines the approach taken to solve the research question stated in the introduction chapter. The context for this problem is derived from the ROCSAFE project \cite{rocsafeNUIG}. \note{Not sure how best to present the problem and how to provide the necessary content to naturally leads to the approaches discussed here. Fill this out further once research questions have been finalized/refined}

\section{Methodology}

\note{Want to outline the process by which the problem was solved in some kind of logical manner. Current idea for structure: }
\note{First identify the problems that ROCSAFE presents}
\note{Instead of rushing headlong into solving difficult problem, identify key aspects of harder problems and develop a suitable method of solving that, making simplifying assumptions as necessary}
\note{Created test-bed in order to explore and evaluate possible solutions}
\note{Identified DBN as a suitable tool to model the problem with flexibility to extend to more complex verions}
\note{Then discuss how DBN and corresponding algos/strategies were modified to incorporate multiple targets, battery and other agents.}
