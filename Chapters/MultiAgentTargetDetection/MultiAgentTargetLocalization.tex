\chapter{Stochastic Target Localization}\label{chap:targetLocalisation}
This chapter outlines the approach taken to solve the research question stated in the introduction chapter. The context for this problem is derived from the ROCSAFE project \cite{Bagherzadeh2017ROCSAFE:Incidents}. We first discuss the technical description of the problem and simplifying assumptions that we made. We then discuss the testbed that was used to prototype the solution. We designed agents to perform the search, taking a similar approach to that outlined in the literature \cite{Chung2007ASearch}, \cite{Chung2008Multi-agentFramework}.
