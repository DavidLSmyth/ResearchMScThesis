\chapter{Stochastic Target Localisation}\label{chap:targetLocalisation}
This chapter outlines the approach taken to address the first research question stated in the introduction chapter:

"\textit{\input{Chapters/Introduction/ResearchQuestion1.tex}}"
\\
This Chapter deals specifically with the problem of \textit{target localisation}, which we explain in precise terms in Section \ref{sec:TLocalisationProbDescription}. The context for this problem is derived from the ROCSAFE project \cite{Bagherzadeh2017ROCSAFE:Incidents}. We first give the technical description of the problem and simplifying assumptions that we made. We then discuss the testbed that was used to prototype the solution. We used a DBN to model the agent's environment, described subsequently. Finally, we present the results of running monte carlo simulations to evaluate the system performance. We designed agents to perform the search, taking a similar approach to the recent literature, noted in Section \ref{sec:StochasticTargetLocalisationRelatedLiterature}.
