\section{Results}
\note{This section includes all results of running the simulation, with reports of expected time to detection being primary focus}


\note{from c\&B analysis of sequential decision making}
\note{Consider the following setting, where a single stationary tar-get is possibly located in a10×10 search region that is depicted in Fig. 5. The initial aggregate beliefB(0) is distributed among theC= 100 cells,  where  the  height  of  the  bars  in  each  cell represents the individual cell belief values, i.e., the probabilityp0cthat the target is present in a given cell, i.e.,c in {1,...,C} . SupposeB(0) = 0.75 ,  which  corresponds  to  an  initial  likeli-hood of 75\% that the target is truly present inA at the beginning of the search process. We examine the evolution of the search decision employing the different search strategies that are presented in the previous section. The search problem parameters that are used for the simulation studies, which are presented in this section, are tabu-lated in Table I. Simulations were allowed to run to completion (i.e., a decision was made), and statistics were calculated over N= 10 000 simulation replications. The values for the detec-tion errors, i.e.,alpha and beta , were chosen to reflect a representative sensor, such as a visual camera that provides aerial imagery in an outdoor and cluttered environment, which could be further calibrated empirically, e.g., by the sensor’s receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Fig.  6  illustrates  the  evolution  of  the  belief  map  as  a search  agent  that  employs  the  myopic  search  strategy  thatmoves through the search region for the given search problem parameters. The searcher attempts to inspect or “clear” cells with the highest cell belief values, which, for the example bimodal belief distribution, requires visiting one peak followed by explo-ration of the other. Note that false-positive and false-negative detections  occur  throughout  the  search  process,  although  the searcher eventually arrives at the true location of the target and correctly terminates the search}
