\section{Simulation Results}



The results presented in this section were generated by running Monte Carlo simulations of the search procedure, since finding a closed-form solution to the mean \textbf{T}ime \textbf{T}o \textbf{D}ecision (TTD) is not readily available in the general case \cite{Chung2012AnalysisStrategies}. We simulated the grid, the agents and the targets in order to evaluate the performance of the system.
%and to analyse how modifying search parameters affects the outcome.
We present statistics related to the Monte Carlo simulations, which reveal how modifying parameters of the search procedure affect the outcome. For each set of parameters in tables \ref{table:VaryingPriorDistribution}, \ref{table:VaryingInitialBelief}, \ref{table:MiscalibratedSensor}, \ref{table:MultipleTargetEGSweep}, \ref{table:MultipleTargetSaccadicRandom} and \ref{table:VaryingNumberOfAgents} we ran 5000 simulations, which finish when the agent (or agents) terminates the search. The parameters that we vary in the simulations are shown in Table \ref{table:SimRunParameters}:

The meaning of each of these parameters is outlined as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The initial belief distribution of each agent describes the distribution of $p(x_0 | e_0, u_0)$, which corresponds to the probability distribution describing its initial belief of the location of the target, prior to gathering any evidence. This may come from prior information about the scene. A Gaussian distribution is peaked, meaning that prior information suggests that some grid cells are more likely to contain the target than others. This can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:InitialGaussian}. A Uniform distribution is not peaked, reflecting no prior information related to the location of the target. This can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:InitialUniform}.
    \item The initial cumulative belief that the target is present in the region is the agent's belief in whether the target is present in the region, prior to gathering any evidence. It is the cumulative sum of the probabilities of the target presence in each of the grid cells. An initial cumulative belief of 0.25 means that initially, the agent is 25\% sure that the target is present in the region. 
    \item The sensor model false positive rate and false negative rate and the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are set out in Section \ref{subsec:stochasticEnvModel}. These can differ from the true rate at which the sensor will observe positive and negative observations. For example, given that the sensor actually outputs false positives and false negatives at a rate of 0.2 and 0.15 respectively, if the sensor model is calibrated with a false positive rate and false negative rate of 0.05 and 0.02 respectively, it will drastically under-estimate the rate at which false readings are recorded, which is reflected in the way it updates its estimated state.
    \item \# of Targets Present gives the number of distinct targets present in the search region. These are assumed to exist in distinct locations.
    \item \# of Agents Used is the number of agents participating in the search.
\end{enumerate}
The results of the simulations show how varying these parameters and suggest how to set them to achieve a desired result. We focus on the most commonly reported metrics in the literature, which are related to the distribution of time to decision \cite{Chung2012AnalysisStrategies}, \cite{Waharte2010ProbabilisticUAVs}, \cite{Waharte2010SupportingUAVs}, \cite{Lau2007OptimalEnvironments}. The time to decision is measured as the number of discrete time-steps before the search concludes. We also report on the rate at which incorrect target locations are returned and the rate at which the agents incorrectly conclude that the target is not present. 

\par For each of the simulations, we arbitrarily chose to use the SPRT cut-off criteria with the upper Type \Romannum{1} error probability set to 0.1 and the upper Type \Romannum{2} error probability set to 0.15. In practice, this meant the agent would terminate the search if its cumulative belief that the target was present exceeded 0.895 or subceeded 0.143. We generated simulated sensor readings using arbitrarily chosen values of the false positive rate = 0.2 and a false negative rate = 0.15. For each simulation run, we generated random starting locations for the agents and targets in a uniformly spaced 10 $\times$ 10 grid. Unless specified otherwise, we use the following default parameters: sensor model false negative rate = 0.15, sensor model false positive rate = 0.2, initial belief distribution = uniform, initial cumulative belief target is present = 0.5, number of targets present = 1, number of active agents = 1, the $\epsilon$-greedy search has $\epsilon$=0.2 and a neighborhood radius of 4. Histograms showing the results of running the simulation with varying parameters are shown in Appendix \ref{chap:AppendixTwo}.
