In this chapter, we presented a custom-built high-fidelity simulation environment which runs on the UE4 game engine. The final results of this are visualised in Figure \ref{fig:finalVirtualEnv}. We published the results of this and released the simulation environment for community use on a public repository. The simulation environment has been used in the ROCSAFE project for multiple purposes and we envision that future work may be able to build on the approach that we took here to generate diverse datasets that may be used to prototype, test and validate systems intended to deal with scenarios that present dangers to humans.
