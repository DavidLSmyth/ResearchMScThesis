In this chapter, we presented a custom-built high-fidelity simulation environment which runs on the UE4 game engine. The final results of this are visualised in Figures \ref{fig:finalVirtualEnv1} and \ref{fig:finalVirtualEnv2}. The solution that we outlined using UE4 and AirSim met all of the criteria set out in Section \ref{subsec:EvalCriteria} and we released the simulation environment for public use on a \href{https://github.com/NUIG-ROCSAFE/CBRNeVirtualEnvironment}{Github repository}\footnote{\href{https://github.com/NUIG-ROCSAFE/CBRNeVirtualEnvironment}{https://github.com/NUIG-ROCSAFE/CBRNeVirtualEnvironment}}.
The simulation environment has been used in the ROCSAFE project for multiple purposes and we envision that future work may be able to build on the approach that we took to generate diverse datasets that may be used to prototype, test and validate systems intended to deal with scenarios that present dangers physical human presence.\par
