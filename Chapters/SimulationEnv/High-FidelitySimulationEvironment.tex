\chapter{High-Fidelity Simulation Environment}\label{chap:HighFidelitySim}

%Designing software to aid the management of a complex and dangerous scene presents many challenges, some of which may not be reasonably foreseen. As mentioned in the motivation section, hazardous events are difficult to prepare for because they tend to be rare and diverse with limited available data from real events. Physical training exercises are not frequently held due to cost, which also limits the amount of data that is available. A consequence of this is that any systems that are developed to provide support can be difficult to evaluate and validate. As outlined in the background knowledge chapter, to the best of our knowledge, there are not many simulations in existence that specifically address these kind of scenarios. To address this, we developed a high-fidelity simulated environment as part of the research involved in this thesis, which preserves the critical aspects of CBRNe incidents without presenting any risk of exposure to the dangerous elements of such scenes in the real world. The following published works related to the development of the simulation environment are discussed in this chapter: \citet{Smyth2018AInvestigation}, \citet{Smyth2018UsingDrones}.\par


\note{alternative beginning}
As highlighted in the introduction, one of the main goals of the ROCSAFE project \cite{Bagherzadeh2017ROCSAFE:Incidents} is to avoid putting forensic investigators in potentially hazardous situation by using autonomous robots in their stead. In order to design and validate this approach, it was desirable to have a test environment. As outlined in the background knowledge chapter, to the best of our knowledge, there are not many simulations in existence that specifically address these kind of hazardous scenarios. To address this, we developed a high-fidelity simulated environment as part of the research involved in this thesis, which preserves the critical aspects of CBRNe incidents without presenting any risk of exposure to the dangerous elements of such scenes in the real world. The following published works related to the development of the simulation environment are discussed in this chapter: \cite{Smyth2018AInvestigation}, \cite{Smyth2018UsingDrones}.
