\chapter{High-Fidelity Simulation Environment}
\placeholder{}
Designing software to aid the management of a complex and dangerous scene presents many challenges, some of which may not be reasonably foreseen. As mentioned in the motivation section, hazardous events are difficult to prepare for because they tend to be rare and diverse that limited data from real events is available. Physical training exercises are not frequently held due to cost, which also limits the amount of data that is available. A consequence of this is that any systems that are developed to provide support can be difficult to evaluate and validate. To address this, a high-fidelity simulated environment has been developed as part of the research involved in this thesis, which maintains the core aspects of CBRNe incidents without any risk of exposure to the dangerous elements of such scenes in the real world. The following published works related to the development of the simulation environment are discussed in this chapter: \cite{Smyth2017AInvestigation}, \cite{GEMDavidSmyth}.\par
