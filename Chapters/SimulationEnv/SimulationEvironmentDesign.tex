\subsubsection{Evaluation Criteria}
In order to design the virtual environment, it was important to first identify the criteria that would determine its usefulness. We began with identifying key phenomena that would need to be present, or integrated in future iterations. This was based on an operational scenario that was outlined in the ROCSAFE project specification\cite{rocsafeNUIG}. Numerous operational scenarios are described that represent distinct classes of CBRNe threat; we picked the one that would be most easily modified for general-purpose use. The core components that the simulation of this scenario requires were identified: 
\note{This is probably the most important part of this chapter}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The ability to place arbitrary physical objects in the scenario in various configurations
    \item The ability to render high-quality images from the scenario from arbitrary locations at arbitrary resolutions.
    \item Multiple heterogeneous simulated aerial vehicles, with a high-level API for sensing and navigation for each vehicle. The API should not be platform-specific.
    \item Simulated sensor readings from the aerial vehicles, including position, velocity, altitude, ... that depend on the state of the aerial vehicle in the environment. For example, if the aerial vehicle is close to a source of radiation, the simulated sensor reading should be high.
    \item Simulation software should have a permissive licence and should permit publications that include details of the software.
\end{itemize}
\note{More can be added to this list.}

\subsubsection{Pre-existing tools and softwares}
In order to provide this functionality, it is clear that using existing tools would be desirable, as writing the boiler plate code necessary to implement such complexity would be extensive. Games engines have been used extensively for simulations of physical phenomena, with a growing interest in niche areas. Examples include generating high-fidelity training data for computer vision algorithms, \cite{QiuUnrealCV:Engine}, deep learning algorithms\cite{GaidonVirtualAnalysis} and automated crowd size estimation algorithms\cite{Lee2018DigitalCrowds}, target tracking algorithms \cite{Mueller2016ATracking}. Most mature games engines offer a common core functionality. This includes some kind of rendering engine for 3D graphics, a physics engine that deals with phenomena such as collision, a sound engine, networking abilities, memory management, threading, cinematics and animation, and some in-built AI capabilities. Referring to the above list, this meant that an emphasis was placed on choosing software with some capability to implement simulated aerial vehicles with the necessary additional details. Specific functionality can commonly be added to games engines using plugins, which are usually specific to an individual games engine.Other standalone simulation tools also exist and their use was considered.\par

The simulation softwares whose potential use for designing a custom simulation environment for disaster scene management which were investigated are as follows, with an overview of each provided in \cite{Ebeid2018ASimulators} and \cite{ShahAirSim:Vehicles}: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gazebo
    \item Airsim
    \item jMAVSim
    \item HackFlightSim
    \item RotorS
\end{itemize}
Other notable simulation platforms that were not seriously considered include \href{https://www.openrobots.org/wiki/morse}{Morse}\footnote{\href {https://www.openrobots.org/wiki/morse}{https://www.openrobots.org/wiki/morse}} and \href{https://github.com/paparazzi/paparazzi}{New Paparazzi Simulator}\footnote{\href {https://github.com/paparazzi/paparazzi}{https://github.com/paparazzi/paparazzi}}. Unreal Engine 4 with the Airsim plugin was chosen to develop the simulation since the documentation for both suggested that it was most suitable in relation to the design requirements/evaluation criteria outlined above.\par

\subsubsection{Unreal Engine Design Process}
\note{might need to re-word this. This section should be about the design process that was used once Unreal Engine had be determined the platform of choice to develop with}
The design process of any simulation or game using Unreal Engine 4 should follow certain good practices in order to avoid some common pitfalls that can cause serious delays in development. \cite 

Unfortunately, most material related to design of simulations and games using UE4 are highly qualitative, addressing questions like "what does the player actually want and how can that be delivered?" rather than describing how the process should proceed.



To ensure that the design process meet

We identified the assets that would be necessary to develop the environment to our specification. These assets were acquired from websites such as 
\href{http://www.cgtrader.com}{CGTrader}\footnote{\href {http://www.cgtrader.com}{https://www.cgtrader.com}}
and 
\href{https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/?hl=en}{Google 3D warehouse}\footnote{\href {https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/?hl=en}{https://www.3dwarehouse.sketchup.com}}. The assets were imported into \emph{Autodesk 3DS} in order to ensure that textures were of sufficient quality to facilitate the planned image processing on collected images. They were then imported into UE4 as static meshes and placed into the scene according to the specification. In order to ensure that this process was scalar and modular, we ensured that static meshes could be replaced by simply importing a new mesh which retains the position of the original in the environment.
